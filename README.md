# Spectral Forecast equation for signals
One of the easiest applications to understand the spectral forecast equation is related to signals. A question that can be asked would be: given two signals A and B, what would a third signal M look like if it must resemble both signals in a certain proportion? For instance, a signal M may be required to resemble signal A in a proportion of 23% and signal B in a remaining proportion of 77%. This is exactly what the spectral equation provides, namely a direct way of obtaining such an intermediary signal. Moreover, the Spectral Forecast equation can also be applied to matrices (two dimensions), but also to mathematical objects with more than two or three dimensions.
