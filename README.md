# Spectral Forecast equation for signals

One of the easiest applications to understand the spectral forecast equation is related to signals. A question that can be asked would be: given two signals <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, what would a third signal <i>M</i> look like if it must resemble both signals in a certain proportion? For instance, a signal <i>M</i> may be required to resemble signal <i>A</i> in a proportion of 23% and signal <i>B</i> in a remaining proportion of 77%. This is exactly what the spectral equation provides, namely a direct way of obtaining such an intermediary signal. Moreover, the Spectral Forecast equation can also be applied to [matrices](https://github.com/Gagniuc/Spectral-Forecast-equation-for-matrices) (two dimensions), but also to mathematical objects with more than two or three dimensions.
